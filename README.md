## An open source and customizable terrain generation tool built in Rust.

The goal of this project is to function as an aid in worldbuilding for any medium. This is my first major project built in Rust, so I would appreciate any criticism you may have about my code. Pull requests welcome.

Roadmap:
- User interface using Bevy UI
    - Add perlin layering for procedural generation
- Erosion simulation (based on user input)
- Heightmap export
- User sculpting
