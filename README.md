# Petra (WIP)

## An open source and customizable terrain generation tool built in Rust.

The goal of this project is to function as an aid in worldbuilding for any medium. This is my first major project built in Rust, so I would appreciate any criticism you may have about my code. Pull requests welcome.

Roadmap:
- GPU erosion simulation
- Node editor?
- Heightmap export

Update (1-18-22):

Now that Bevy 0.6 has come out, I can finally begin work on utilizing compute shaders for sculpting. My IRL schedule has also freed up some more, allowing me to dedicate more time to this project.
